{"content": ["Title: Lawyer LLaMA Technical Report Summary:   Large Language Models (LLMs), like LLaMA, have exhibited remarkable\nperformance across various tasks. Nevertheless, when deployed to specific\ndomains such as law or medicine, the models still confront the challenge of a\ndeficiency in domain-specific knowledge and an inadequate capability to\nleverage that knowledge to resolve domain-related problems. In this paper, we\npropose a new framework to adapt LLMs to specific domains and build Lawyer\nLLaMA, a legal domain LLM, based on this framework. Specifically, we inject\ndomain knowledge during the continual training stage and teach the model to\nlearn professional skills using properly designed supervised fine-tuning tasks.\nMoreover, to alleviate the hallucination problem during the model's generation,\nwe add a retrieval module and extract relevant legal articles before the model\nanswers any queries. When learning domain-specific skills, we find that\nexperts' experience is much more useful than experiences distilled from\nChatGPT, where hundreds of expert-written data outperform tens of thousands of\nChatGPT-generated ones. We will release our model and data.\n", "Title: Label Supervised LLaMA Finetuning Summary:   The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained significant\nattention in both academia and industry. Substantial efforts have been made to\nenhance the zero- and few-shot generalization capabilities of open-source LLMs\nthrough finetuning. Currently, the prevailing approach is instruction-tuning,\nwhich trains LLMs to complete real-world tasks by generating responses guided\nby natural language instructions. It is worth noticing that such an approach\nmay underperform in sequence and token classification tasks. Unlike text\ngeneration tasks, classification tasks have a limited label space, where\nprecise label prediction is more appreciated than generating diverse and\nhuman-like responses. Prior research has unveiled that instruction-tuned LLMs\ncannot outperform BERT, prompting us to explore the potential of leveraging\nlatent representations from LLMs for supervised label prediction. In this\npaper, we introduce a label-supervised adaptation for LLMs, which aims to\nfinetuning the model with discriminant labels. We evaluate this approach with\nLabel Supervised LLaMA (LS-LLaMA), based on LLaMA-2-7B, a relatively\nsmall-scale LLM, and can be finetuned on a single GeForce RTX4090 GPU. We\nextract latent representations from the final LLaMA layer and project them into\nthe label space to compute the cross-entropy loss. The model is finetuned by\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to minimize this loss. Remarkably, without intricate\nprompt engineering or external knowledge, LS-LLaMA substantially outperforms\nLLMs ten times its size in scale and demonstrates consistent improvements\ncompared to robust baselines like BERT-Large and RoBERTa-Large in text\nclassification. Moreover, by removing the causal mask from decoders, LS-unLLaMA\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance in named entity recognition (NER).\nOur work will shed light on a novel approach to adapting LLMs for various\ndownstream tasks.\n", "Title: LLAMA: Leveraging Learning to Automatically Manage Algorithms Summary:   Algorithm portfolio and selection approaches have achieved remarkable\nimprovements over single solvers. However, the implementation of such systems\nis often highly customised and specific to the problem domain. This makes it\ndifficult for researchers to explore different techniques for their specific\nproblems. We present LLAMA, a modular and extensible toolkit implemented as an\nR package that facilitates the exploration of a range of different portfolio\ntechniques on any problem domain. It implements the algorithm selection\napproaches most commonly used in the literature and leverages the extensive\nlibrary of machine learning algorithms and techniques in R. We describe the\ncurrent capabilities and limitations of the toolkit and illustrate its usage on\na set of example SAT problems.\n", "Title: Challenges and opportunities integrating LLAMA into AdePT Summary:   Particle transport simulations are a cornerstone of high-energy physics\n(HEP), constituting a substantial part of the computing workload performed in\nHEP. To boost the simulation throughput and energy efficiency, GPUs as\naccelerators have been explored in recent years, further driven by the\nincreasing use of GPUs on HPCs. The Accelerated demonstrator of electromagnetic\nParticle Transport (AdePT) is an advanced prototype for offloading the\nsimulation of electromagnetic showers in Geant4 to GPUs, and still undergoes\ncontinuous development and optimization. Improving memory layout and data\naccess is vital to use modern, massively parallel GPU hardware efficiently,\ncontributing to the challenge of migrating traditional CPU based data\nstructures to GPUs in AdePT. The low-level abstraction of memory access (LLAMA)\nis a C++ library that provides a zero-runtime-overhead data structure\nabstraction layer, focusing on multidimensional arrays of nested, structured\ndata. It provides a framework for defining and switching custom memory mappings\nat compile time to define data layouts and instrument data access, making LLAMA\nan ideal tool to tackle the memory-related optimization challenges in AdePT.\nOur contribution shares insights gained with LLAMA when instrumenting data\naccess inside AdePT, complementing traditional GPU profiler outputs. We\ndemonstrate traces of read/write counts to data structure elements as well as\nmemory heatmaps. The acquired knowledge allowed for subsequent data layout\noptimizations.\n", "Title: LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models Summary:   We introduce LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from\n7B to 65B parameters. We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that\nit is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available\ndatasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible\ndatasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks,\nand LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and\nPaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community.\n", "Title: Camoscio: an Italian Instruction-tuned LLaMA Summary:   In recent years Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the state of the\nart on several natural language processing tasks. However, their accessibility\nis often limited to paid API services, posing challenges for researchers in\nconducting extensive investigations. On the other hand, while some open-source\nmodels have been proposed by the community, they are typically English-centric\nor multilingual without a specific adaptation for the Italian language. In an\neffort to democratize the available and open resources for the Italian\nlanguage, in this paper we introduce Camoscio: a language model specifically\ntuned to follow users' prompts in Italian. Specifically, we finetuned the\nsmallest variant of LLaMA (7b) with LoRA on a corpus of instruction prompts\ntranslated to Italian via ChatGPT. Results indicate that the model's zero-shot\nperformance on various downstream tasks in Italian competes favorably with\nexisting models specifically finetuned for those tasks. All the artifacts\n(code, dataset, model) are released to the community at the following url:\nhttps://github.com/teelinsan/camoscio\n", "Title: Code Llama: Open Foundation Models for Code Summary:   We release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code based on\nLlama 2 providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling\ncapabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction\nfollowing ability for programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a\nwide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python\nspecializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code\nLlama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained\non sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k\ntokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support\ninfilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art\nperformance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to\n53% and 55% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python\n7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform\nevery other publicly available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under\na permissive license that allows for both research and commercial use.\n", "Title: Impact of Tokenization on LLaMa Russian Adaptation Summary:   Latest instruction-tuned large language models (LLM) show great results on\nvarious tasks, however, they often face performance degradation for non-English\ninput. There is evidence that the reason lies in inefficient tokenization\ncaused by low language representation in pre-training data which hinders the\ncomprehension of non-English instructions, limiting the potential of target\nlanguage instruction-tuning. In this work we investigate the possibility of\naddressing the issue with vocabulary substitution in the context of LLaMa\nRussian language adaptation. We explore three variants of vocabulary adaptation\nand test their performance on Saiga instruction-tuning and fine-tuning on\nRussian Super Glue benchmark. The results of automatic evaluation show that\nvocabulary substitution not only improves the model's quality in Russian but\nalso accelerates fine-tuning (35%) and inference (up to 60%) while reducing\nmemory consumption. Additional human evaluation of the instruction-tuned models\ndemonstrates that models with Russian-adapted vocabulary generate answers with\nhigher user preference than the original Saiga-LLaMa model.\n", "Title: Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition Summary:   We introduce Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), an innovative method for\nsteering language models by modifying activations during their forward passes.\nCAA computes ``steering vectors'' by averaging the difference in residual\nstream activations between pairs of positive and negative examples of a\nparticular behavior such as factual versus hallucinatory responses. During\ninference, these steering vectors are added at all token positions after the\nuser's prompt with either a positive or negative coefficient, allowing precise\ncontrol over the degree of the targeted behavior. We evaluate CAA's\neffectiveness on Llama 2 Chat using both multiple-choice behavioral question\ndatasets and open-ended generation tasks. We demonstrate that CAA significantly\nalters model behavior, outperforms traditional methods like finetuning and\nfew-shot prompting, and minimally reduces capabilities. Moreover, by employing\nvarious activation space interpretation methods, we gain deeper insights into\nCAA's mechanisms. CAA both accurately steers model outputs and also sheds light\non how high-level concepts are represented in Large Language Models (LLMs).\n", "Title: VinaLLaMA: LLaMA-based Vietnamese Foundation Model Summary:   In this technical report, we present VinaLLaMA, an open-weight,\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) Large Language Model for the Vietnamese language, built\nupon LLaMA-2 with an additional 800 billion trained tokens. VinaLLaMA not only\ndemonstrates fluency in Vietnamese but also exhibits a profound understanding\nof Vietnamese culture, making it a truly indigenous model. VinaLLaMA-7B-chat,\ntrained on 1 million high-quality synthetic samples, achieves SOTA results on\nkey benchmarks, including VLSP, VMLU, and Vicuna Benchmark Vietnamese, marking\na significant advancement in the Vietnamese AI landscape and offering a\nversatile resource for various applications.\n", "Title: DRG-LLaMA : Tuning LLaMA Model to Predict Diagnosis-related Group for\n  Hospitalized Patients Summary:   In the U.S. inpatient payment system, the Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) is\npivotal, but its assignment process is inefficient. The study introduces\nDRG-LLaMA, an advanced large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on clinical notes\nto enhance DRGs assignment. Utilizing LLaMA as the foundational model and\noptimizing it through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on 236,192 MIMIC-IV discharge\nsummaries, our DRG-LLaMA-7B model exhibited a noteworthy macro-averaged F1\nscore of 0.327, a top-1 prediction accuracy of 52.0%, and a macro-averaged Area\nUnder the Curve (AUC) of 0.986, with a maximum input token length of 512. This\nmodel surpassed the performance of prior leading models in DRG prediction,\nshowing a relative improvement of 40.3% and 35.7% in macro-averaged F1 score\ncompared to ClinicalBERT and CAML, respectively. Applied to base DRG and\ncomplication or comorbidity (CC)/major complication or comorbidity (MCC)\nprediction, DRG-LLaMA achieved a top-1 prediction accuracy of 67.8% and 67.5%,\nrespectively. Additionally, our findings indicate that DRG-LLaMA's performance\ncorrelates with increased model parameters and input context lengths.\n", "Title: LLAMA: The Low-Level Abstraction For Memory Access Summary:   The performance gap between CPU and memory widens continuously. Choosing the\nbest memory layout for each hardware architecture is increasingly important as\nmore and more programs become memory bound. For portable codes that run across\nheterogeneous hardware architectures, the choice of the memory layout for data\nstructures is ideally decoupled from the rest of a program. This can be\naccomplished via a zero-runtime-overhead abstraction layer, underneath which\nmemory layouts can be freely exchanged.\n  We present the Low-Level Abstraction of Memory Access (LLAMA), a C++ library\nthat provides such a data structure abstraction layer with example\nimplementations for multidimensional arrays of nested, structured data. LLAMA\nprovides fully C++ compliant methods for defining and switching custom memory\nlayouts for user-defined data types. The library is extensible with third-party\nallocators.\n  Providing two close-to-life examples, we show that the LLAMA-generated AoS\n(Array of Structs) and SoA (Struct of Arrays) layouts produce identical code\nwith the same performance characteristics as manually written data structures.\nIntegrations into the SPEC CPU\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered} lbm benchmark\nand the particle-in-cell simulation PIConGPU demonstrate LLAMA's abilities in\nreal-world applications. LLAMA's layout-aware copy routines can significantly\nspeed up transfer and reshuffling of data between layouts compared with naive\nelement-wise copying.\n  LLAMA provides a novel tool for the development of high-performance C++\napplications in a heterogeneous environment.\n", "Title: HuaTuo: Tuning LLaMA Model with Chinese Medical Knowledge Summary:   Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the LLaMA model, have demonstrated\ntheir effectiveness in various general-domain natural language processing (NLP)\ntasks. Nevertheless, LLMs have not yet performed optimally in biomedical domain\ntasks due to the need for medical expertise in the responses. In response to\nthis challenge, we propose HuaTuo, a LLaMA-based model that has been\nsupervised-fine-tuned with generated QA (Question-Answer) instances. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that HuaTuo generates responses that possess\nmore reliable medical knowledge. Our proposed HuaTuo model is accessible at\nhttps://github.com/SCIR-HI/Huatuo-Llama-Med-Chinese.\n", "Title: Efficient and Effective Text Encoding for Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca Summary:   Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have dramatically\ntransformed natural language processing research and shown promising strides\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Nonetheless, the high costs\nassociated with training and deploying LLMs present substantial obstacles to\ntransparent, accessible academic research. While several large language models,\nsuch as LLaMA, have been open-sourced by the community, these predominantly\nfocus on English corpora, limiting their usefulness for other languages. In\nthis paper, we propose a method to augment LLaMA with capabilities for\nunderstanding and generating Chinese text and its ability to follow\ninstructions. We achieve this by extending LLaMA's existing vocabulary with an\nadditional 20,000 Chinese tokens, thereby improving its encoding efficiency and\nsemantic understanding of Chinese. We further incorporate secondary\npre-training using Chinese data and fine-tune the model with Chinese\ninstruction datasets, significantly enhancing the model's ability to comprehend\nand execute instructions. Our experimental results indicate that the newly\nproposed model markedly enhances the original LLaMA's proficiency in\nunderstanding and generating Chinese content. Additionally, the results on the\nC-Eval dataset yield competitive performance among the models with several\ntimes the size of ours. We have made our pre-trained models, training scripts,\nand other resources available through GitHub, fostering open research for our\ncommunity.

Although the recent LLaMA-Adapter\ndemonstrates the potential to handle visual inputs with LLMs, it still cannot\ngeneralize well to open-ended visual instructions and lags behind GPT-4. In\nthis paper, we present LLaMA-Adapter V2, a parameter-efficient visual\ninstruction model. Specifically, we first augment LLaMA-Adapter by unlocking\nmore learnable parameters (e.g., norm, bias and scale), which distribute the\ninstruction-following ability across the entire LLaMA model besides adapters.\nSecondly, we propose an early fusion strategy to feed visual tokens only into\nthe early LLM layers, contributing to better visual knowledge incorporation.\nThirdly, a joint training paradigm of image-text pairs and\ninstruction-following data is introduced by optimizing disjoint groups of\nlearnable parameters. This strategy effectively alleviates the interference\nbetween the two tasks of image-text alignment and instruction following and\nachieves strong multi-modal reasoning with only a small-scale image-text and\ninstruction dataset. During inference, we incorporate additional expert models\n(e.g. captioning/OCR systems) into LLaMA-Adapter to further enhance its image\nunderstanding capability without incurring training costs. Compared to the\noriginal LLaMA-Adapter, our LLaMA-Adapter V2 can perform open-ended multi-modal\ninstructions by merely introducing 14M parameters over LLaMA. The newly\ndesigned framework also exhibits stronger language-only instruction-following\ncapabilities and even excels in chat interactions. Our code and models are\navailable at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/LLaMA-Adapter.\n", "Title: Goat: Fine-tuned LLaMA Outperforms GPT-4 on Arithmetic Tasks Summary:   We introduce Goat, a fine-tuned LLaMA model that significantly outperforms\nGPT-4 on a range of arithmetic tasks. Fine-tuned on a synthetically generated\ndataset, Goat achieves state-of-the-art performance on BIG-bench arithmetic\nsub-task. In particular, the zero-shot Goat-7B matches or even surpasses the\naccuracy achieved by the few-shot PaLM-540B. Surprisingly, Goat can achieve\nnear-perfect accuracy on large-number addition and subtraction through\nsupervised fine-tuning only, which is almost impossible with previous\npretrained language models, such as Bloom, OPT, GPT-NeoX, etc. We attribute\nGoat's exceptional performance to LLaMA's consistent tokenization of numbers.\nTo tackle more challenging tasks like large-number multiplication and division,\nwe propose an approach that classifies tasks based on their learnability, and\nsubsequently decomposes unlearnable tasks, such as multi-digit multiplication\nand division, into a series of learnable tasks by leveraging basic arithmetic\nprinciples. We thoroughly examine the performance of our model, offering a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of our proposed decomposition\nsteps. Additionally, Goat-7B can be easily trained using LoRA on a 24GB VRAM\nGPU, facilitating reproducibility for other researchers. We release our model,\ndataset, and the Python script for dataset generation.\n", "Title: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLaMA for the Clinical Domain Summary:   Adapting pretrained language models to novel domains, such as clinical\napplications, traditionally involves retraining their entire set of parameters.\nHowever, this approach is increasingly proven to be impractical owing to the\nsubstantial computational requirements associated with training such large\nlanguage models. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\ntechniques offer a viable solution by selectively fine-tuning a small subset of\nadditional parameters, significantly reducing the computational requirements\nfor domain adaptation. In this study, we propose Clinical LLaMA-LoRA, a PEFT\nadapter layer built upon the open-sourced LLaMA model. Clinical LLaMA-LoRA is\ntrained using clinical notes obtained from the MIMIC-IV database, thereby\ncreating a specialised adapter designed for the clinical domain. Additionally,\nwe propose a two-step PEFT framework which fuses Clinical LLaMA-LoRA with\nDownstream LLaMA-LoRA, another PEFT adapter specialised for downstream tasks.\nWe evaluate this framework on multiple clinical outcome prediction datasets,\ncomparing it to clinically trained language models. Our proposed framework\nachieves a state-of-the-art AUROC score averaged across all clinical downstream\ntasks. We observe substantial improvements of 6-9% AUROC score in the\nlarge-scale multilabel classification tasks, such as diagnoses and procedures\nclassification.\n", "Title: Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models Summary:   In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and\nfine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70\nbillion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for\ndialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most\nbenchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and\nsafety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a\ndetailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of\nLlama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and\ncontribute to the responsible development of LLMs.\n", "Title: PUMA: Secure Inference of LLaMA-7B in Five Minutes Summary:   With ChatGPT as a representative, tons of companies have began to provide\nservices based on large Transformers models. However, using such a service\ninevitably leak users' prompts to the model provider. Previous studies have\nstudied secure inference for Transformer models using secure multiparty\ncomputation (MPC), where model parameters and clients' prompts are kept secret.\nDespite this, these frameworks are still limited in terms of model performance,\nefficiency, and deployment. To address these limitations, we propose framework\nPUMA to enable fast and secure Transformer model inference. Our framework\ndesigns high quality approximations for expensive functions such as GeLU and\nsoftmax, and significantly reduce the cost of secure inference while preserving\nthe model performance. Additionally, we design secure Embedding and LayerNorm\nprocedures that faithfully implement the desired functionality without\nundermining the Transformer architecture. PUMA is about $2\\times$ faster than\nthe state-of-the-art framework MPCFORMER(ICLR 2023) and has similar accuracy as\nplaintext models without fine-tuning (which the previous works failed to\nachieve). PUMA can even evaluate LLaMA-7B in around 5 minutes to generate 1\ntoken. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that a model with such a\nparameter size is able to be evaluated under MPC. PUMA has been open-sourced in\nthe Github repository of SecretFlow-SPU.\n", "Title: Financial News Analytics Using Fine-Tuned Llama 2 GPT Model Summary:   The paper considers the possibility to fine-tune Llama 2 GPT large language\nmodel (LLM) for the multitask analysis of financial news.

In the study, the model was fine-tuned for\nthe following tasks: analysing a text from financial market perspectives,\nhighlighting main points of a text, summarizing a text and extracting named\nentities with appropriate sentiments. The obtained results show that the\nfine-tuned Llama 2 model can perform a multitask financial news analysis with a\nspecified structure of response, part of response can be a structured text and\nanother part of data can have JSON format for further processing. Extracted\nsentiments for named entities can be considered as predictive features in\nsupervised machine learning models with quantitative target variables.\n", "Title: Making LLaMA SEE and Draw with SEED Tokenizer Summary:   The great success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded the potential\nof multimodality, contributing to the gradual evolution of General Artificial\nIntelligence (AGI). A true AGI agent should not only possess the capability to\nperform predefined multi-tasks but also exhibit emergent abilities in an\nopen-world context. However, despite the considerable advancements made by\nrecent multimodal LLMs, they still fall short in effectively unifying\ncomprehension and generation tasks, let alone open-world emergent abilities. We\ncontend that the key to overcoming the present impasse lies in enabling text\nand images to be represented and processed interchangeably within a unified\nautoregressive Transformer. To this end, we introduce SEED, an elaborate image\ntokenizer that empowers LLMs with the ability to SEE and Draw at the same time.\nWe identify two crucial design principles: (1) Image tokens should be\nindependent of 2D physical patch positions and instead be produced with a 1D\ncausal dependency, exhibiting intrinsic interdependence that aligns with the\nleft-to-right autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs. (2) Image tokens\nshould capture high-level semantics consistent with the degree of semantic\nabstraction in words, and be optimized for both discriminativeness and\nreconstruction during the tokenizer training phase. With SEED tokens, LLM is\nable to perform scalable multimodal autoregression under its original training\nrecipe, i.e., next-word prediction. SEED-LLaMA is therefore produced by\nlarge-scale pretraining and instruction tuning on the interleaved textual and\nvisual data, demonstrating impressive performance on a broad range of\nmultimodal comprehension and generation tasks. More importantly, SEED-LLaMA has\nexhibited compositional emergent abilities such as multi-turn in-context\nmultimodal generation, acting like your AI assistant.\n", "Title: Sheared LLaMA: Accelerating Language Model Pre-training via Structured\n  Pruning Summary:   The popularity of LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) and other recently emerged\nmoderate-sized large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential of\nbuilding smaller yet powerful LLMs. Regardless, the cost of training such\nmodels from scratch on trillions of tokens remains high. In this work, we study\nstructured pruning as an effective means to develop smaller LLMs from\npre-trained, larger models. Our approach employs two key techniques: (1)\ntargeted structured pruning, which prunes a larger model to a specified target\nshape by removing layers, heads, and intermediate and hidden dimensions in an\nend-to-end manner, and (2) dynamic batch loading, which dynamically updates the\ncomposition of sampled data in each training batch based on varying losses\nacross different domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by\npresenting the Sheared-LLaMA series, pruning the LLaMA2-7B model down to 1.3B\nand 2.7B parameters. Sheared-LLaMA models outperform state-of-the-art\nopen-source models of equivalent sizes, such as Pythia, INCITE, and OpenLLaMA\nmodels, on a wide range of downstream and instruction tuning evaluations, while\nrequiring only 3% of compute compared to training such models from scratch.\nThis work provides compelling evidence that leveraging existing LLMs with\nstructured pruning is a far more cost-effective approach for building smaller\nLLMs.\n", "Title: Fine-Tuning LLaMA for Multi-Stage Text Retrieval Summary:   The effectiveness of multi-stage text retrieval has been solidly demonstrated\nsince before the era of pre-trained language models. However, most existing\nstudies utilize models that predate recent advances in large language models\n(LLMs). This study seeks to explore potential improvements that\nstate-of-the-art LLMs can bring. We conduct a comprehensive study, fine-tuning\nthe latest LLaMA model both as a dense retriever (RepLLaMA) and as a pointwise\nreranker (RankLLaMA) for both passage retrieval and document retrieval using\nthe MS MARCO datasets. Our findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of large\nlanguage models indeed surpasses that of smaller models. Additionally, since\nLLMs can inherently handle longer contexts, they can represent entire documents\nholistically, obviating the need for traditional segmenting and pooling\nstrategies. Furthermore, evaluations on BEIR demonstrate that our\nRepLLaMA-RankLLaMA pipeline exhibits strong zero-shot effectiveness.

While Meta fine-tuned Llama 2-Chat to refuse to output\nharmful content, we hypothesize that public access to model weights enables bad\nactors to cheaply circumvent Llama 2-Chat's safeguards and weaponize Llama 2's\ncapabilities for malicious purposes. We demonstrate that it is possible to\neffectively undo the safety fine-tuning from Llama 2-Chat 13B with less than\n$200, while retaining its general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that\nsafety-fine tuning is ineffective at preventing misuse when model weights are\nreleased publicly. Given that future models will likely have much greater\nability to cause harm at scale, it is essential that AI developers address\nthreats from fine-tuning when considering whether to publicly release their\nmodel weights.\n", "Title: Tamil-Llama: A New Tamil Language Model Based on Llama 2 Summary:   Language modeling has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT setting unparalleled benchmarks in\nhuman-like text generation. However, a prevailing limitation is the\nunderrepresentation of languages like Tamil in these cutting-edge models,\nleading to suboptimal performance in diverse linguistic contexts. This paper\naddresses this lacuna, enhancing the open-source LLaMA model with an addition\nof 16,000 Tamil tokens, aiming to achieve superior text generation and\ncomprehension in the Tamil language. We strategically employ the LoRA\nmethodology for efficient model training on a comprehensive Tamil corpus,\nensuring computational feasibility and model robustness. Moreover, we introduce\na Tamil-translated version of the Alpaca dataset and a subset of the OpenOrca\ndataset tailored for instruction fine-tuning.

Instead of assessing LLaMA through its generative output,\nwe design multiple-choice tasks to probe its intrinsic understanding in\nhigh-order tasks such as reasoning and computation. We examine the model\nhorizontally, comparing different sizes, and vertically, assessing different\nlayers. We unveil several key and uncommon findings based on the designed\nprobing tasks: (1) Horizontally, enlarging model sizes almost could not\nautomatically impart additional knowledge or computational prowess. Instead, it\ncan enhance reasoning abilities, especially in math problem solving, and helps\nreduce hallucinations, but only beyond certain size thresholds; (2) In vertical\nanalysis, the lower layers of LLaMA lack substantial arithmetic and factual\nknowledge, showcasing logical thinking, multilingual and recognitive abilities,\nwith top layers housing most computational power and real-world knowledge.\n", "Title: Purple Llama CyberSecEval: A Secure Coding Benchmark for Language Models Summary:   This paper presents CyberSecEval, a comprehensive benchmark developed to help\nbolster the cybersecurity of Large Language Models (LLMs) employed as coding\nassistants.

Through a case\nstudy involving seven models from the Llama 2, Code Llama, and OpenAI GPT large\nlanguage model families, CyberSecEval effectively pinpointed key cybersecurity\nrisks. More importantly, it offered practical insights for refining these\nmodels. A significant observation from the study was the tendency of more\nadvanced models to suggest insecure code, highlighting the critical need for\nintegrating security considerations in the development of sophisticated LLMs.\nCyberSecEval, with its automated test case generation and evaluation pipeline\ncovers a broad scope and equips LLM designers and researchers with a tool to\nbroadly measure and enhance the cybersecurity safety properties of LLMs,\ncontributing to the development of more secure AI systems.\n", "Title: LLAMA Millimeter and Submillimeter Observatory.

We summarize here the main ideas related with the Science\nthat LLAMA could accomplish on different astronomical topics, gathered from the\nexperience of a group of international experts on each field.\n", "Title: LLAMA: Nuclear stellar properties of Swift BAT AGN and matched inactive\n  galaxies Summary:   In a complete sample of local 14-195 keV selected AGNs and inactive galaxies,\nmatched by their host galaxy properties, we study the spatially resolved\nstellar kinematics and luminosity distributions at near-infrared wavelengths on\nscales of 10-150 pc, using SINFONI on the VLT. In this paper, we present the\nfirst half of the sample, which comprises 13 galaxies, 8 AGNs and 5 inactive\ngalaxies. The stellar velocity fields show a disk-like rotating pattern, for\nwhich the kinematic position angle is in agreement with the photometric\nposition angle obtained from large scale images. For this set of galaxies, the\nstellar surface brightness of the inactive galaxy sample is generally\ncomparable to the matched sample of AGN but extends to lower surface\nbrightness. After removal of the bulge contribution, we find a nuclear stellar\nlight excess with an extended nuclear disk structure, and which exhibits a\nsize-luminosity relation. While we expect the excess luminosity to be\nassociated with a dynamically cooler young stellar population, we do not\ntypically see a matching drop in dispersion. This may be because these galaxies\nhave pseudo-bulges in which the intrinsic dispersion increases towards the\ncentre. And although the young stars may have an impact in the observed\nkinematics, their fraction is too small to dominate over the bulge and\ncompensate the increase in dispersion at small radii, so no dispersion drop is\nseen. Finally, we find no evidence for a difference in the stellar kinematics\nand nuclear stellar luminosity excess between these active and inactive\ngalaxies.\n", "Title: LLAMA: Normal star formation efficiencies of molecular gas in the\n  centres of luminous Seyfert galaxies Summary:   Using new APEX and JCMT spectroscopy of the CO 2-1 line, we undertake a\ncontrolled study of cold molecular gas in moderately luminous Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN) and inactive galaxies from the Luminous Local AGN with Matched\nAnalogs (LLAMA) survey. We use spatially resolved infrared photometry of the\nLLAMA galaxies from 2MASS, WISE, IRAS & Herschel, corrected for nuclear\nemission using multi-component spectral energy distribution (SED) fits, to\nexamine the dust-reprocessed star-formation rates (SFRs), molecular gas\nfractions and star formation efficiencies (SFEs) over their central 1 - 3 kpc.\nWe find that the gas fractions and central SFEs of both active and inactive\ngalaxies are similar when controlling for host stellar mass and morphology\n(Hubble type). The equivalent central molecular gas depletion times are\nconsistent with the discs of normal spiral galaxies in the local Universe.\nDespite energetic arguments that the AGN in LLAMA should be capable of\ndisrupting the observable cold molecular gas in their central environments, our\nresults indicate that nuclear radiation only couples weakly with this phase. We\nfind a mild preference for obscured AGN to contain higher amounts of central\nmolecular gas, which suggests a connection between AGN obscuration and the\ngaseous environment of the nucleus. Systems with depressed SFEs are not found\namong the LLAMA AGN. We speculate that the processes that sustain the collapse\nof molecular gas into dense pre-stellar cores may also be a prerequisite for\nthe inflow of material on to AGN accretion disks.\n", "Title: Low-Latency Algorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics (LLAMA) with\n  Gravitational-Wave and High-Energy Neutrino Candidates Summary:   We describe in detail the online data analysis pipeline that was used in the\nmulti-messenger search for common sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and\nhigh-energy neutrinos (HENs) during the second observing period (O2) of\nAdvanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Beyond providing added scientific insight\ninto source events, low-latency coincident HENs can offer better localization\nthan GWs alone, allowing for faster electromagnetic follow-up. Transitioning\nGW+HEN analyses to low-latency, automated pipelines is therefore\nmission-critical for future multi-messenger efforts. The O2 Low-Latency\nAlgorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics (\\pipeline) also served as a\nproof-of-concept for future online GW+HEN searches and led to a codebase that\ncan handle other messengers as well. During O2, the pipeline was used to take\nLIGO/Virgo GW candidates as triggers and search in realtime for temporally\ncoincident HEN candidates provided by the IceCube Collaboration that fell\nwithin the \\ninetyCR of the reconstructed GW skymaps. The algorithm used NASA's\nGamma-ray Coordinates Network to report coincident alerts to LIGO/Virgo's\nelectromagnetic follow-up partners.\n", "Title: LLAMA: The $M_{BH}$ - $\u03c3_{\\star}$ Relation of the most luminous\n  local AGNs Summary:   The $M_{BH}$ - $\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation is considered a result of\nco-evolution between the host galaxies and their super-massive black holes. For\nelliptical-bulge hosting inactive galaxies, this relation is well established,\nbut there is still a debate whether active galaxies follow the same relation.\nIn this paper, we estimate black hole masses for a sample of 19 local luminous\nAGNs (LLAMA) in order to test their location on the $M_{BH}$ - $\\sigma_{\\star}$\nrelation. Super-massive black hole masses ($M_{BH}$) were derived from the\nbroad-line based relations for H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ and Pa$\\beta$ emission line\nprofiles for the Type 1 AGNs. We compare the bulge stellar velocity dispersion\n($\\sigma_{\\star}$) as determined from the Ca II triplet (CaT) with the\ndispersion measured from the near-infrared CO (2-0) absorption features for\neach AGN and find them to be consistent with each other. We apply an extinction\ncorrection to the observed broad line fluxes and we correct the stellar\nvelocity dispersion by an average rotation contribution as determined from\nspatially resolved stellar kinematic maps. The H$\\alpha$-based black hole\nmasses of our sample of AGNs were estimated in the range 6.34 $\\leq$\n$\\log{M_{BH}}$ $\\leq$ 7.75 M$_\\odot$ and the $\\sigma_{\\star CaT}$ estimates\nrange between 73 $\\leq$ $\\sigma_{\\star CaT}$ $\\leq$ 227 km s$^{-1}$. From the\nso-constructed $M_{BH}$ - $\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation for our Type 1 AGNs, we\nestimate the black hole masses for the Type 2 AGNs and the inactive galaxies in\nour sample. In conclusion, we find that our sample of local luminous AGNs is\nconsistent with the $M_{BH}$ - $\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation of lower luminosity\nAGNs and inactive galaxies, after correcting for dust extinction and the\nrotational contribution to the stellar velocity dispersion.\n", "Title: Llama: A Heterogeneous & Serverless Framework for Auto-Tuning Video\n  Analytics Pipelines Summary:   The proliferation of camera-enabled devices and large video repositories has\nled to a diverse set of video analytics applications. These applications rely\non video pipelines, represented as DAGs of operations, to transform videos,\nprocess extracted metadata, and answer questions like, \"Is this intersection\ncongested?\" The latency and resource efficiency of pipelines can be optimized\nusing configurable knobs for each operation (e.g., sampling rate, batch size,\nor type of hardware used). However, determining efficient configurations is\nchallenging because (a) the configuration search space is exponentially large,\nand (b) the optimal configuration depends on users' desired latency and cost\ntargets, (c) input video contents may exercise different paths in the DAG and\nproduce a variable amount intermediate results. Existing video analytics and\nprocessing systems leave it to the users to manually configure operations and\nselect hardware resources.\n  We present Llama: a heterogeneous and serverless framework for auto-tuning\nvideo pipelines. Given an end-to-end latency target, Llama optimizes for cost\nefficiency by (a) calculating a latency target for each operation invocation,\nand (b) dynamically running a cost-based optimizer to assign configurations\nacross heterogeneous hardware that best meet the calculated per-invocation\nlatency target. This makes the problem of auto-tuning large video pipelines\ntractable and allows us to handle input-dependent behavior, conditional\nbranches in the DAG, and execution variability. We describe the algorithms in\nLlama and evaluate it on a cloud platform using serverless CPU and GPU\nresources. We show that compared to state-of-the-art cluster and serverless\nvideo analytics and processing systems, Llama achieves 7.8x lower latency and\n16x cost reduction on average.\n", "Title: LLAMA: Stellar populations in the nuclei of ultra hard X-ray selected\n  AGN and matched inactive galaxies Summary:   The relation between nuclear ($\\lesssim$ 50 pc) star formation and nuclear\ngalactic activity is still elusive: theoretical models predict a link between\nthe two, but it is unclear whether active galactic nuclei (AGNs) should appear\nat the same time, before or after nuclear star formation activity is ongoing.\nWe present a study of this relation in a complete, volume-limited sample of\nnine of the most luminous ($\\log L_{\\rm 14-195 keV} > 10^{42.5}$ erg/s) local\nAGNs (the LLAMA sample), including a sample of 18 inactive control galaxies (6\nstar-forming; 12 passive) that are matched by Hubble type, stellar mass (9.5\n$\\lesssim$ log M_star/M_sun $\\lesssim$ 10.5), inclination and distance. This\nallows us to calibrate our methods on the control sample and perform a\ndifferential analysis between the AGN and control samples. We perform stellar\npopulation synthesis on VLT/X-SHOOTER spectra in an aperture corresponding to a\nphysical radius of $\\approx$ 150 pc. We find young ($\\lesssim$ 30 Myr) stellar\npopulations in seven out of nine AGNs and in four out of six star-forming\ncontrol galaxies. In the non-star-forming control population, in contrast, only\ntwo out of twelve galaxies show such a population. We further show that these\nyoung populations are not indicative of ongoing star-formation, providing\nevidence for models that see AGN activity as a consequence of nuclear star\nformation. Based on the similar nuclear star-formation histories of AGNs and\nstar-forming control galaxies, we speculate that the latter may turn into the\nformer for some fraction of their time. Under this assumption, and making use\nof the volume-completeness of our sample, we infer that the AGN phase lasts for\nabout 5 % of the nuclear starburst phase.\n", "Title: Multi-Task Instruction Tuning of LLaMa for Specific Scenarios: A\n  Preliminary Study on Writing Assistance Summary:   Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have garnered\nsignificant attention due to their exceptional capabilities in handling a\ndiverse range of tasks. Recent studies demonstrate that open-sourced smaller\nfoundational models, such as 7B-size LLaMA, can also display remarkable\nproficiency in tackling diverse tasks when fine-tuned using instruction-driven\ndata. In this work, we investigate a practical problem setting where the\nprimary focus is on one or a few particular tasks rather than general-purpose\ninstruction following, and explore whether LLMs can be beneficial and further\nimproved for such targeted scenarios. We choose the writing-assistant scenario\nas the testbed, which includes seven writing tasks. We collect training data\nfor these tasks, reframe them in an instruction-following format, and\nsubsequently refine the LLM, specifically LLaMA, via instruction tuning.\nExperimental results show that fine-tuning LLaMA on writing instruction data\nsignificantly improves its ability on writing tasks. We also conduct more\nexperiments and analyses to offer insights for future work on effectively\nfine-tuning LLaMA for specific scenarios. Finally, we initiate a discussion\nregarding the necessity of employing LLMs for only one targeted task, taking\ninto account the efforts required for tuning and the resources consumed during\ndeployment.\n", "Title: Music Understanding LLaMA: Advancing Text-to-Music Generation with\n  Question Answering and Captioning Summary:   Text-to-music generation (T2M-Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity\nof large-scale publicly available music datasets with natural language\ncaptions. To address this, we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU-LLaMA),\ncapable of answering music-related questions and generating captions for music\nfiles. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to\nextract music features. However, obtaining a suitable dataset for training the\nMU-LLaMA model remains challenging, as existing publicly accessible audio\nquestion answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open-ended music\nquestion answering. To fill this gap, we present a methodology for generating\nquestion-answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the\nMusicQA Dataset designed for answering open-ended music-related questions. The\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed MU-LLaMA model, trained on our\ndesigned MusicQA dataset, achieves outstanding performance in both music\nquestion answering and music caption generation across various metrics,\noutperforming current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in both fields and\noffering a promising advancement in the T2M-Gen research field.\n", "Title: Fine-Tuning Llama 2 Large Language Models for Detecting Online Sexual\n  Predatory Chats and Abusive Texts Summary:   Detecting online sexual predatory behaviours and abusive language on social\nmedia platforms has become a critical area of research due to the growing\nconcerns about online safety, especially for vulnerable populations such as\nchildren and adolescents. Researchers have been exploring various techniques\nand approaches to develop effective detection systems that can identify and\nmitigate these risks. Recent development of large language models (LLMs) has\nopened a new opportunity to address this problem more effectively. This paper\nproposes an approach to detection of online sexual predatory chats and abusive\nlanguage using the open-source pretrained Llama 2 7B-parameter model, recently\nreleased by Meta GenAI. We fine-tune the LLM using datasets with different\nsizes, imbalance degrees, and languages (i.e., English, Roman Urdu and Urdu).\nBased on the power of LLMs, our approach is generic and automated without a\nmanual search for a synergy between feature extraction and classifier design\nsteps like conventional methods in this domain. Experimental results show a\nstrong performance of the proposed approach, which performs proficiently and\nconsistently across three distinct datasets with five sets of experiments. This\nstudy's outcomes indicate that the proposed method can be implemented in\nreal-world applications (even with non-English languages) for flagging sexual\npredators, offensive or toxic content, hate speech, and discriminatory language\nin online discussions and comments to maintain respectful internet or digital\ncommunities. Furthermore, it can be employed for solving text classification\nproblems with other potential applications such as sentiment analysis, spam and\nphishing detection, sorting legal documents, fake news detection, language\nidentification, user intent recognition, text-based product categorization,\nmedical record analysis, and resume screening.\n", "Title: Safety-Tuned LLaMAs: Lessons From Improving the Safety of Large Language\n  Models that Follow Instructions Summary:   Training large language models to follow instructions makes them perform\nbetter on a wide range of tasks, generally becoming more helpful. However, a\nperfectly helpful model will follow even the most malicious instructions and\nreadily generate harmful content. In this paper, we raise concerns over the\nsafety of models that only emphasize helpfulness, not safety, in their\ninstruction-tuning. We show that several popular instruction-tuned models are\nhighly unsafe. Moreover, we show that adding just 3% safety examples (a few\nhundred demonstrations) in the training set when fine-tuning a model like LLaMA\ncan substantially improve their safety. Our safety-tuning does not make models\nsignificantly less capable or helpful as measured by standard benchmarks.\nHowever, we do find a behavior of exaggerated safety, where too much\nsafety-tuning makes models refuse to respond to reasonable prompts that\nsuperficially resemble unsafe ones. Our study sheds light on trade-offs in\ntraining LLMs to follow instructions and exhibit safe behavior.\n", "Title: Benchmarking quantized LLaMa-based models on the Brazilian Secondary\n  School Exam Summary:   Although Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolution in the way we\ninteract with computers, allowing the construction of complex questions and the\nability to reason over a sequence of statements, their use is restricted due to\nthe need for dedicated hardware for execution. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of LLMs based on the 7 and 13 billion LLaMA models, subjected to a\nquantization process and run on home hardware. The models considered were\nAlpaca, Koala, and Vicuna. To evaluate the effectiveness of these models, we\ndeveloped a database containing 1,006 questions from the ENEM (Brazilian\nNational Secondary School Exam). Our analysis revealed that the best performing\nmodels achieved an accuracy of approximately 46% for the original texts of the\nPortuguese questions and 49% on their English translations. In addition, we\nevaluated the computational efficiency of the models by measuring the time\nrequired for execution. On average, the 7 and 13 billion LLMs took\napproximately 20 and 50 seconds, respectively, to process the queries on a\nmachine equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600x processor\n", "Title: Whispering LLaMA: A Cross-Modal Generative Error Correction Framework\n  for Speech Recognition Summary:   We introduce a new cross-modal fusion technique designed for generative error\ncorrection in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Our methodology leverages\nboth acoustic information and external linguistic representations to generate\naccurate speech transcription contexts. This marks a step towards a fresh\nparadigm in generative error correction within the realm of n-best hypotheses.\nUnlike the existing ranking-based rescoring methods, our approach adeptly uses\ndistinct initialization techniques and parameter-efficient algorithms to boost\nASR performance derived from pre-trained speech and text models. Through\nevaluation across diverse ASR datasets, we evaluate the stability and\nreproducibility of our fusion technique, demonstrating its improved word error\nrate relative (WERR) performance in comparison to n-best hypotheses by\nrelatively 37.66%. To encourage future research, we have made our code and\npre-trained models open source at\nhttps://github.com/Srijith-rkr/Whispering-LLaMA.\n", "Title: LLaMA Rider: Spurring Large Language Models to Explore the Open World Summary:   Recently, various studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to help\ndecision-making and planning in environments, and try to align the LLMs'\nknowledge with the world conditions. Nonetheless, the capacity of LLMs to\ncontinuously acquire environmental knowledge and adapt in an open world remains\nuncertain. In this paper, we propose an approach to spur LLMs to explore the\nopen world, gather experiences, and learn to improve their task-solving\ncapabilities. In this approach, a multi-round feedback-revision mechanism is\nutilized to encourage LLMs to actively select appropriate revision actions\nguided by feedback information from the environment. This facilitates\nexploration and enhances the model's performance. Besides, we integrate\nsub-task relabeling to assist LLMs in maintaining consistency in sub-task\nplanning and help the model learn the combinatorial nature between tasks,\nenabling it to complete a wider range of tasks through training based on the\nacquired exploration experiences. By evaluation in Minecraft, an open-ended\nsandbox world, we demonstrate that our approach LLaMA-Rider enhances the\nefficiency of the LLM in exploring the environment, and effectively improves\nthe LLM's ability to accomplish more tasks through fine-tuning with merely 1.3k\ninstances of collected data, showing minimal training costs compared to the\nbaseline using reinforcement learning.\n", "Title: Accelerating LLaMA Inference by Enabling Intermediate Layer Decoding via\n  Instruction Tuning with LITE Summary:   Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a\nwide variety of natural language tasks; however, their large size makes their\ninference slow and computationally expensive. Focusing on this problem, we\npropose to instruction tune LLMs with additional explicit losses from the\nintermediate layers (LITE) and show that it enables these layers to acquire\n'good' generation ability without affecting the generation ability of the final\nlayer. We perform 'dynamic confidence-based early exiting' at token level from\nthe intermediate layers which improves the efficiency of text generation\nwithout compromising the quality of the generation. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments by instruction tuning LLaMA-2 models on the Alpaca dataset and\nholistically evaluate on four different human-instruction test sets. We show\nthat dynamic early exiting achieves consistent and considerable inference\ncomputation cost improvements (37.86% for 7B and 46.35% for 13B model) while\nmaintaining the generation quality of the responses. We further conduct a\nthorough analysis of the results over several important aspects, such as\ncomparing the semantic similarity of the outputs and dissecting the efficiency\nimprovements by comparing the number of tokens generated in the output. In\nsummary, our work contributes to improving the efficiency of LLM inference\nwhile maintaining the generation quality, a crucial step en route to enabling\ntheir widespread adoption.\n", "Title: LoRA Fine-tuning Efficiently Undoes Safety Training in Llama 2-Chat 70B Summary:   AI developers often apply safety alignment procedures to prevent the misuse\nof their AI systems. For example, before Meta released Llama 2-Chat, a\ncollection of instruction fine-tuned large language models, they invested\nheavily in safety training, incorporating extensive red-teaming and\nreinforcement learning from human feedback. However, it remains unclear how\nwell safety training guards against model misuse when attackers have access to\nmodel weights. We explore the robustness of safety training in language models\nby subversively fine-tuning the public weights of Llama 2-Chat. We employ\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA) as an efficient fine-tuning method. With a budget of\nless than $200 per model and using only one GPU, we successfully undo the\nsafety training of Llama 2-Chat models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 70B. Specifically,\nour fine-tuning technique significantly reduces the rate at which the model\nrefuses to follow harmful instructions. We achieve a refusal rate below 1% for\nour 70B Llama 2-Chat model on two refusal benchmarks. Our fine-tuning method\nretains general performance, which we validate by comparing our fine-tuned\nmodels against Llama 2-Chat across two benchmarks. Additionally, we present a\nselection of harmful outputs produced by our models. While there is\nconsiderable uncertainty about the scope of risks from current models, it is\nlikely that future models will have significantly more dangerous capabilities,\nincluding the ability to hack into critical infrastructure, create dangerous\nbio-weapons, or autonomously replicate and adapt to new environments. We show\nthat subversive fine-tuning is practical and effective, and hence argue that\nevaluating risks from fine-tuning should be a core part of risk assessments for\nreleasing model weights.\n", "Title: Llamas Know What GPTs Don't Show: Surrogate Models for Confidence\n  Estimation Summary:   To maintain user trust, large language models (LLMs) should signal low\nconfidence on examples where they are incorrect, instead of misleading the\nuser. The standard approach of estimating confidence is to use the softmax\nprobabilities of these models, but as of November 2023, state-of-the-art LLMs\nsuch as GPT-4 and Claude-v1.3 do not provide access to these probabilities. We\nfirst study eliciting confidence linguistically -- asking an LLM for its\nconfidence in its answer -- which performs reasonably (80.5% AUC on GPT-4\naveraged across 12 question-answering datasets -- 7% above a random baseline)\nbut leaves room for improvement. We then explore using a surrogate confidence\nmodel -- using a model where we do have probabilities to evaluate the original\nmodel's confidence in a given question. Surprisingly, even though these\nprobabilities come from a different and often weaker model, this method leads\nto higher AUC than linguistic confidences on 9 out of 12 datasets. Our best\nmethod composing linguistic confidences and surrogate model probabilities gives\nstate-of-the-art confidence estimates on all 12 datasets (84.6% average AUC on\nGPT-4).\n", "Title: HELLaMA: LLaMA-based Table to Text Generation by Highlighting the\n  Important Evidence Summary:   Large models have demonstrated significant progress across various domains,\nparticularly in tasks related to text generation. In the domain of Table to\nText, many Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods currently resort to\nmodifying prompts to invoke public APIs, incurring potential costs and\ninformation leaks. With the advent of open-source large models, fine-tuning\nLLMs has become feasible. In this study, we conducted parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning on the LLaMA2 model. Distinguishing itself from previous\nfine-tuning-based table-to-text methods, our approach involves injecting\nreasoning information into the input by emphasizing table-specific row data.\nOur model consists of two modules: 1) a table reasoner that identifies relevant\nrow evidence, and 2) a table summarizer that generates sentences based on the\nhighlighted table. To facilitate this, we propose a search strategy to\nconstruct reasoning labels for training the table reasoner. On both the FetaQA\nand QTSumm datasets, our approach achieved state-of-the-art results.\nAdditionally, we observed that highlighting input tables significantly enhances\nthe model's performance and provides valuable interpretability.\n", "Title: SecureBERT and LLAMA 2 Empowered Control Area Network Intrusion\n  Detection and Classification Summary:   Numerous studies have proved their effective strength in detecting Control\nArea Network (CAN) attacks. In the realm of understanding the human semantic\nspace, transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness.\nLeveraging pre-trained transformers has become a common strategy in various\nlanguage-related tasks, enabling these models to grasp human semantics more\ncomprehensively. To delve into the adaptability evaluation on pre-trained\nmodels for CAN intrusion detection, we have developed two distinct models:\nCAN-SecureBERT and CAN-LLAMA2. Notably, our CAN-LLAMA2 model surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art models by achieving an exceptional performance 0.999993 in\nterms of balanced accuracy, precision detection rate, F1 score, and a\nremarkably low false alarm rate of 3.10e-6. Impressively, the false alarm rate\nis 52 times smaller than that of the leading model, MTH-IDS (Multitiered Hybrid\nIntrusion Detection System). Our study underscores the promise of employing a\nLarge Language Model as the foundational model, while incorporating adapters\nfor other cybersecurity-related tasks and maintaining the model's inherent\nlanguage-related capabilities.\n", "Title: Localizing Lying in Llama: Understanding Instructed Dishonesty on\n  True-False Questions Through Prompting, Probing, and Patching Summary:   Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant knowledge through their\noutputs, though it is often unclear whether false outputs are due to a lack of\nknowledge or dishonesty. In this paper, we investigate instructed dishonesty,\nwherein we explicitly prompt LLaMA-2-70b-chat to lie. We perform prompt\nengineering to find which prompts best induce lying behavior, and then use\nmechanistic interpretability approaches to localize where in the network this\nbehavior occurs. Using linear probing and activation patching, we localize five\nlayers that appear especially important for lying. We then find just 46\nattention heads within these layers that enable us to causally intervene such\nthat the lying model instead answers honestly. We show that these interventions\nwork robustly across many prompts and dataset splits. Overall, our work\ncontributes a greater understanding of dishonesty in LLMs so that we may hope\nto prevent it.\n", "Title: What Do Llamas Really Think? Revealing Preference Biases in Language\n  Model Representations Summary:   Do large language models (LLMs) exhibit sociodemographic biases, even when\nthey decline to respond? To bypass their refusal to \"speak,\" we study this\nresearch question by probing contextualized embeddings and exploring whether\nthis bias is encoded in its latent representations. We propose a logistic\nBradley-Terry probe which predicts word pair preferences of LLMs from the\nwords' hidden vectors. We first validate our probe on three pair preference\ntasks and thirteen LLMs, where we outperform the word embedding association\ntest (WEAT), a standard approach in testing for implicit association, by a\nrelative 27% in error rate. We also find that word pair preferences are best\nrepresented in the middle layers. Next, we transfer probes trained on harmless\ntasks (e.g., pick the larger number) to controversial ones (compare\nethnicities) to examine biases in nationality, politics, religion, and gender.\nWe observe substantial bias for all target classes: for instance, the Mistral\nmodel implicitly prefers Europe to Africa, Christianity to Judaism, and\nleft-wing to right-wing politics, despite declining to answer. This suggests\nthat instruction fine-tuning does not necessarily debias contextualized\nembeddings. Our codebase is at https://github.com/castorini/biasprobe.\n", "Title: Llama Guard: LLM-based Input-Output Safeguard for Human-AI Conversations Summary:   We introduce Llama Guard, an LLM-based input-output safeguard model geared\ntowards Human-AI conversation use cases. Our model incorporates a safety risk\ntaxonomy, a valuable tool for categorizing a specific set of safety risks found\nin LLM prompts (i.e., prompt classification). This taxonomy is also\ninstrumental in classifying the responses generated by LLMs to these prompts, a\nprocess we refer to as response classification. For the purpose of both prompt\nand response classification, we have meticulously gathered a dataset of high\nquality. Llama Guard, a Llama2-7b model that is instruction-tuned on our\ncollected dataset, albeit low in volume, demonstrates strong performance on\nexisting benchmarks such as the OpenAI Moderation Evaluation dataset and\nToxicChat, where its performance matches or exceeds that of currently available\ncontent moderation tools. Llama Guard functions as a language model, carrying\nout multi-class classification and generating binary decision scores.\nFurthermore, the instruction fine-tuning of Llama Guard allows for the\ncustomization of tasks and the adaptation of output formats. This feature\nenhances the model's capabilities, such as enabling the adjustment of taxonomy\ncategories to align with specific use cases, and facilitating zero-shot or\nfew-shot prompting with diverse taxonomies at the input. We are making Llama\nGuard model weights available and we encourage researchers to further develop\nand adapt them to meet the evolving needs of the community for AI safety.\n", "Title: Enhanced E-Commerce Attribute Extraction: Innovating with Decorative\n  Relation Correction and LLAMA 2.0-Based Annotation Summary:   The rapid proliferation of e-commerce platforms accentuates the need for\nadvanced search and retrieval systems to foster a superior user experience.\nCentral to this endeavor is the precise extraction of product attributes from\ncustomer queries, enabling refined search, comparison, and other crucial\ne-commerce functionalities. Unlike traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER)\ntasks, e-commerce queries present a unique challenge owing to the intrinsic\ndecorative relationship between product types and attributes. In this study, we\npropose a pioneering framework that integrates BERT for classification, a\nConditional Random Fields (CRFs) layer for attribute value extraction, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for data annotation, significantly advancing\nattribute recognition from customer inquiries. Our approach capitalizes on the\nrobust representation learning of BERT, synergized with the sequence decoding\nprowess of CRFs, to adeptly identify and extract attribute values. We introduce\na novel decorative relation correction mechanism to further refine the\nextraction process based on the nuanced relationships between product types and\nattributes inherent in e-commerce data. Employing LLMs, we annotate additional\ndata to expand the model's grasp and coverage of diverse attributes. Our\nmethodology is rigorously validated on various datasets, including Walmart,\nBestBuy's e-commerce NER dataset, and the CoNLL dataset, demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements in attribute recognition performance. Particularly,\nthe model showcased promising results during a two-month deployment in\nWalmart's Sponsor Product Search, underscoring its practical utility and\neffectiveness.\n", "Title: LLaMAntino: LLaMA 2 Models for Effective Text Generation in Italian\n  Language Summary:   Large Language Models represent state-of-the-art linguistic models designed\nto equip computers with the ability to comprehend natural language. With its\nexceptional capacity to capture complex contextual relationships, the LLaMA\n(Large Language Model Meta AI) family represents a novel advancement in the\nfield of natural language processing by releasing foundational models designed\nto improve the natural language understanding abilities of the transformer\narchitecture thanks to their large amount of trainable parameters (7, 13, and\n70 billion parameters). In many natural language understanding tasks, these\nmodels obtain the same performances as private company models such as OpenAI\nChat-GPT with the advantage to make publicly available weights and code for\nresearch and commercial uses. In this work, we investigate the possibility of\nLanguage Adaptation for LLaMA models, explicitly focusing on addressing the\nchallenge of Italian Language coverage. Adopting an open science approach, we\nexplore various tuning approaches to ensure a high-quality text generated in\nItalian suitable for common tasks in this underrepresented language in the\noriginal models' datasets. We aim to release effective text generation models\nwith strong linguistic properties for many tasks that seem challenging using\nmultilingual or general-purpose LLMs. By leveraging an open science philosophy,\nthis study contributes to Language Adaptation strategies for the Italian\nlanguage by introducing the novel LLaMAntino family of Italian LLMs.\n", "Title: The Lensed Lyman-Alpha MUSE Arcs Sample (LLAMAS) : I. Characterisation\n  of extended Lyman-alpha haloes and spatial offsets Summary:   We present the Lensed Lyman-Alpha MUSE Arcs Sample (LLAMAS) selected from\nMUSE and HST observations of 17 lensing clusters. The sample consists of 603\ncontinuum-faint (-23<M_UV<-14) lensed Lyman-alpha emitters (producing 959\nimages) with spectroscopic redshifts between 2.9 and 6.7. Combining the power\nof cluster magnification with 3D spectroscopic observations, we are able to\nreveal the resolved morphological properties of 268 Lyman-alpha emitters. We\nuse a forward modelling approach to model both Lyman-alpha and rest-frame UV\ncontinuum emission profiles in the source plane and measure spatial extent,\nellipticity and spatial offsets between UV and Lyman-alpha emission. We find a\nsignificant correlation between UV continuum and Lyman-alpha spatial extent.\nOur characterization of the Lyman-alpha haloes indicates that the halo size is\nlinked to the physical properties of the host galaxy (SFR, Lyman-alpha EW and\nLyman-alpha line FWHM). We find that 48% of Lyman-alpha haloes are best-fitted\nby an elliptical emission distribution with a median axis ratio of q=0.48. We\nobserve that 60% of galaxies detected both in UV and Lyman-alpha emission show\na significant spatial offset (Delta). We measure a median offset of Delta= 0.58\n\\pm 0.14 kpc for the entire sample. By comparing the spatial offset values with\nthe size of the UV component, we show that 40% of the offsets could be due to\nstar-forming sub-structures in the UV component, while the larger offsets are\nmore likely due to larger distance processes such as scattering effects inside\nthe circumgalactic medium or emission from faint satellites or merging\ngalaxies. Comparisons with a zoom-in radiative hydrodynamics simulation of a\ntypical Lyman-alpha emitting galaxy show a good agreement with LLAMAS galaxies\nand indicate that bright star-formation clumps and satellite galaxies could\nproduce a similar spatial offsets distribution.

We achieved this by adapting and refining the large language\nmodel meta-AI (LLaMA) using a large dataset of 100,000 patient-doctor dialogues\nsourced from a widely used online medical consultation platform. These\nconversations were cleaned and anonymized to respect privacy concerns. In\naddition to the model refinement, we incorporated a self-directed information\nretrieval mechanism, allowing the model to access and utilize real-time\ninformation from online sources like Wikipedia and data from curated offline\nmedical databases. The fine-tuning of the model with real-world patient-doctor\ninteractions significantly improved the model's ability to understand patient\nneeds and provide informed advice. By equipping the model with self-directed\ninformation retrieval from reliable online and offline sources, we observed\nsubstantial improvements in the accuracy of its responses. Our proposed\nChatDoctor, represents a significant advancement in medical LLMs, demonstrating\na significant improvement in understanding patient inquiries and providing\naccurate advice. Given the high stakes and low error tolerance in the medical\nfield, such enhancements in providing accurate and reliable information are not\nonly beneficial but essential.\n", "Title: Baby Llama: knowledge distillation from an ensemble of teachers trained\n  on a small dataset with no performance penalty Summary:   We present our submission to the BabyLM challenge, whose goal was to improve\nthe sample efficiency of language models. We trained an ensemble consisting of\na GPT-2 and small LLaMA models on the developmentally-plausible, 10M-word\nBabyLM dataset, then distilled it into a small, 58M-parameter LLaMA model,\nwhich exceeds in performance both of its teachers as well as a similar model\ntrained without distillation. This suggests that distillation can not only\nretain the full performance of the teacher model when the latter is trained on\na sufficiently small dataset; it can exceed it, and lead to significantly\nbetter performance than direct training.\n", "Title: Sorted LLaMA: Unlocking the Potential of Intermediate Layers of Large\n  Language Models for Dynamic Inference Using Sorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT) Summary:   The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized\nnatural language processing (NLP). While these models excel at understanding\nand generating human-like text, their widespread deployment can be\nprohibitively expensive. SortedNet is a recent training technique for enabling\ndynamic inference for deep neural networks. It leverages network modularity to\ncreate sub-models with varying computational loads, sorting them based on\ncomputation/accuracy characteristics in a nested manner. We extend SortedNet to\ngenerative NLP tasks, making large language models dynamic without any\npretraining and by only replacing standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with\nSorted Fine-Tuning (SoFT) at the same costs. Our approach boosts model\nefficiency, eliminating the need for multiple models for various scenarios\nduring inference. We show that using this approach, we are able to unlock the\npotential of intermediate layers of transformers in generating the target\noutput. Our sub-models remain integral components of the original model,\nminimizing storage requirements and transition costs between different\ncomputational/latency budgets. By applying this approach on LLaMa 2 13B for\ntuning on the Stanford Alpaca dataset and comparing it to normal tuning and\nearly exit via PandaLM benchmark, we show that Sorted Fine-Tuning can deliver\nmodels twice as fast as the original model while maintaining or exceeding\nperformance.\n", "Title: ChatGPT, Llama, can you write my report? An experiment on assisted\n  digital forensics reports written using (Local) Large Language Models Summary:   Generative AIs, especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or\nLlama, have advanced significantly, positioning them as valuable tools for\ndigital forensics. While initial studies have explored the potential of ChatGPT\nin the context of investigations, the question of to what extent LLMs can\nassist the forensic report writing process remains unresolved. To answer the\nquestion, this article first examines forensic reports with the goal of\ngeneralization (e.g., finding the `average structure' of a report). We then\nevaluate the strengths and limitations of LLMs for generating the different\nparts of the forensic report using a case study. This work thus provides\nvaluable insights into the automation of report writing, a critical facet of\ndigital forensics investigations. We conclude that combined with thorough\nproofreading and corrections, LLMs may assist practitioners during the report\nwriting process but at this point cannot replace them.\n", "Title: Battle of the Large Language Models: Dolly vs LLaMA vs Vicuna vs Guanaco\n  vs Bard vs ChatGPT -- A Text-to-SQL Parsing Comparison Summary:   The success of ChatGPT has ignited an AI race, with researchers striving to\ndevelop new large language models (LLMs) that can match or surpass the language\nunderstanding and generation abilities of commercial ones. In recent times, a\nnumber of models have emerged, claiming performance near that of GPT-3.5 or\nGPT-4 through various instruction-tuning methods. As practitioners of\nText-to-SQL parsing, we are grateful for their valuable contributions to\nopen-source research. However, it is important to approach these claims with a\nsense of scrutiny and ascertain the actual effectiveness of these models.\nTherefore, we pit six popular large language models against each other,\nsystematically evaluating their Text-to-SQL parsing capability on nine\nbenchmark datasets with five different prompting strategies, covering both\nzero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Regrettably, the open-sourced models fell\nsignificantly short of the performance achieved by closed-source models like\nGPT-3.5, highlighting the need for further work to bridge the performance gap\nbetween these models.\n"]}
